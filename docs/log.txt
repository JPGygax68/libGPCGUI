Todos at this point:

- Decide how to handle auto-sizing of widgets:
  - minWidth(), minHeight(): computed, set externally, or both ?
  - or just silently adjust externally set size ?
  - or interpret size = 0 as "auto" ?
  
- Trigger repaint when view-model state changes
  - but avoid recursion crash
  - actually a simple button doesn't have state
  
- Trigger repaint when view state changes
  -> implement display region invalidate
